##  Domain 1 : Cloud Concepts
### Subdomain 1.1 Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition
- Client-server model
	- In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with, to make requests to computer **servers**.
- Cloud computing definition:
	- The **on-demand delivery** of **IT resources** over the **internet** with **pay-as-you-go** pricing
- **On-demand** delivery means:
	- AWS has the resources that you need when you need them. You don't need to tell us in advance that you're going to need them.
- What **"over the Internet"** implies, on Cloud Computing definition
	- You can access those resources using a secure web page console or via CLI of programmatically
- - ***"Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT:"***
	- Task that are common, often repetitive and ultimately time-consuming, for instance install SQL Engine
- üî• Six **advantages** of Cloud Computing
	- Trade **upfront** expense for **variable** expense
	- Benefit from massive **economies of scale**
	- Stop guessing **capacity**
	- Increase **speed and agility**
	- Stop spending money to run and maintain **data centers**.
	- Go **global** in minutes
- What advantage of cloud computing do we mean when we say that instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before knowing how they are going to be used, you can pay only when computing resources are consumed and pay only for how much it is consumed?
	- **Trade fixed expense for variable expense**
- What advantage of cloud computing de we mean when we say that you can achieve a lower costs than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated to the cloud, providers such as AWS can get lower costs, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
	- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
- Which advantage of cloud computing is, when you don't need to guess  your infrastructure capacity needs prior to deploying an application,  in the cloud you can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes‚Äô notice.
	- **Stop guessing capacity**¬†
- Which cloud computing advantage are you seizing, when you have  IT resources are only a click away for your developers, resulting in a dramatic increase in the speed for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
	- **Increase speed and agility**¬†
- Which cloud computing advantage do we refer, when we say that you can focus on projects that differentiate your business, your customers, etc, instead of focusing on the IT infrastructure activities such as racking, stacking and powering servers?
	-  **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
- Which cloud computing advantage are you seizing, when you can easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
	- **Go global in minutes**

	- Deploy globally in minutes
- Systems that are designed to operate continuously without failure for a long time. These systems avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures. We are talking about `High Availability
- With `elasticity`, you don't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need. You can provision only what you need, and then grow and shrink based on demand.
- In the cloud all the service you have access helps you to innovate faster, giving you speed to market, we are talking about `agility.`
- The cloud gives you long-term data protection. This means your data will remain intact without corruption, we are talking about `durability`.
- `Scalability` is the ability of a system to easily increase in size and capacity in a cost-effective way.
- At the highest level, the `AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)` organize guidance for cloud adoption into six area of focus, called `Perspectives`.

- `Replatforming`, also known as ‚Äúlift, tinker, and shift,‚Äù involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the **core architecture** of the application.
- `Refactoring`¬†(also known as¬†*re-architecting*) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features.
- **Refactoring** is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application‚Äôs existing environment. (false or true)
	- True
- `Repurchasing`¬†involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.
- `Retaining`¬†consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.
- `Retiring`¬†is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.

### Subdomain 1.2 Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics
